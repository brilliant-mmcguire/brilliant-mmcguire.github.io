## What we are all about 
Our vision is of a world in which experienced professionals and practitioners invest their career capital in others to build a sustainable, prosperous and fair society for everyone.

Our mission is to help makers & doers of social goods bring great ideas to life, and then support them on their journey toward a resilient livelihood for themselves, and positive impact for their community.

Our approach is to bring the right mix of people, resources and governance together to innovate toward a brilliant vision and realise brilliant outcomes. 

## For good makers & doers 
We provide makers & doers of social goods with the investment, support, expertise and networks to launch and build a successful future for themselves and those they serve. We welcome individuals, charities, social enterprises, mission-led businesses and organisations. 

You simply have a brilliant idea or project that needs support and investment to realise environmental or social impact that’s aligned with the UN’s SDGs. 

## For our member network
Our network of supporters and proactive investors are people who are rich in experience and have a wealth of career capital - expertise, skills and other resources - to call on. They have busy lives but also a determination to make a difference by helping others.

Our members are motivated first by making a positive impact and second by maintaining and growing their career capital. These assets include experience, social and professional network, skills, and financial. 

Our memebers bring their whole selves to the table and commit their full canopy of resources; their time, energy, know-how, expertise and money. This is proactive capital at work. 

Our prime specialism is digital - product engineering, service delivery, strategy and transformation - complimented with expertise in other fields.

We ask our members to invest career capital alongside financial capital.  
- Financial investment is made on a matched funding basis. 
- SEIS and EIS for equity investments. 
- SITR for loan investments

## For partners 
We partner with companies, foundations, charities, national and international government organisations.  Our partners further the innovate-for-good movement through funding, investment, community engagement, expertise and insights.

## Our projects 
We support individuals, charities, social enterprises, businesses and other organisations with practical and financial capital. Our strength is tech and innovation and we have broad conception of what that means. We believe brilliant outcomes result from the capabilities of dedicated teams of people.  For us, success looks like a commercially sustainable company of motivated and capable people serving their users, customers and community.  

## Equity, diversity and inclusion
We want to advance equity, diversity and inclusion in every dimension of what we do and hold ourselves accountable for the results.

## Our philosophy & approach
Big changes result from incremental steps, taken in common purpose, toward a shared vision. 
Innovation is about novel change, experimental variation, introducing new things into established settings. 
Innovation is not about appropriating exclusive rights to IP and global scale, although this can be an outcome of technical invention.  

Our approach and framework for success rest on our many years of experience delivering tech-enabled innovation. 

- Experiment and adapt 
- Iterative plan and predict 
- Fast value delivery and feedback cycles
- Practical governance
