## What we are all about 
Our vision is of a world in which experienced professionals and practitioners, rich in experience, proactively invest their career capital in others to build a sustainable, prosperous and fair society for everyone.

Our mission is to help makers & doers of social goods bring great ideas to life, and then support them on their journey toward a resilient livelihood for themselves, and positive impact for their community.

Our approach is to bring the right mix of people, resources and governance together to innovate toward a brilliant vision and realise brilliant outcomes. 

## For social makers & doers 
We provide makers & doers of social goods with the investment, support, expertise and networks to launch and build a successful future for themselves and those they serve. We welcome individuals, charities, social enterprises, mission-led businesses and organisations. You must simply have a brilliant idea or project that needs support and investment to realise environmental or social impact that’s aligned with the UN’s SDGs. 

## For supporters & investors
Our network of supporters and investors are people who are rich in experience and copious career capital - expertise, skills and other resources to call on. They have busy lives but also a determination to make a difference by helping others.

Our investors are motivated first by making a positive impact and second by maintaining and growing their career capital. These assets include experience, social and professional network, skills, and financial. 

Our investors commit their full canopy of resources; their time, energy, know-how, expertise and money. This is proactive capital at work. 

Our prime specialism is digital - product engineering, service delivery, strategy and transformation - complimented with expertise in complementary fields.

## For partners 
Alongside our work as investors in social and environmental impact, we partner with companies, foundations, charities and national and international government organisations to further the tech for good movement. 

## Our portfolio 
We support individuals, charities, social enterprises, businesses and other organisations with practical and financial capital. Our focus is on tech and innovation and we have broad conception of what that means.
